**PROBLEM STATEMENT 1**
**About the Project**

The Skill Swap Platform is a web-based application designed to foster collaborative learning and resource exchange through a community-driven skill-sharing network. Users can list the skills they offer and those they seek to learn, enabling a mutually beneficial swapping system. The platform emphasizes user autonomy, discovery, and secure interaction, with features supporting privacy, transparency, and accountability.

Key Features:

User Profiles: Each user can create a profile with skills offered and wanted, profile photos, and optional details such as name and location.
Privacy Controls: Users can mark their profiles as public or private.
Skill-Based Discovery: Users can search or browse others based on specific skills.
Swap Requests: A full cycle of request management—sending, accepting, rejecting, tracking status, and deleting unaccepted requests.
Ratings & Feedback (Upcoming): A post-swap review system to promote accountability.
Admin Dashboard: For platform moderation, content control, user banning, message broadcasting, and report generation.
Responsive Design: The platform is evolving toward full mobile compatibility.
This project demonstrates a strong foundation in full-stack web development, user authentication, real-time data management, and admin tooling, with a focus on scalability and usability.

Approach
The Skill Swap Platform was developed using a modular, full-stack approach with iterative enhancements to user experience, backend security, and administrative control. Below is the phased methodology used:

Phase 1: Planning & Design
Requirements gathering for core features (authentication, profile creation, skill listing, and swap requests).
Wireframing and UI/UX flow design.
Database schema planning (users, skills, requests, ratings, etc.).
Phase 2: Backend Development
Tech Stack: Likely using Node.js/Express or Django/Flask for API development.
Authentication: Secure user authentication using JWT (JSON Web Tokens).
Profile Management: RESTful API endpoints for creating and updating user profiles, with fields for skills, privacy settings, and media uploads.
Swap Request System: Backend logic for sending/receiving/accepting/rejecting requests, with status tracking.
Phase 3: Frontend Development
Framework: Likely React (SPA setup with routing) or similar.
Multi-Page Routing: Implemented for clean navigation (Dashboard, Search, Requests, Admin Panel).
Skill Discovery: Search bar and filters to browse users by offered/wanted skills.
Profile Photo Integration: Upload and view support.
Responsive Layouts: Initial mobile layout improvements for better accessibility.
Phase 4: Admin Functionality
Admin interface for:

Viewing all swap requests and statuses.
Moderating skill tags/descriptions.
Banning users who violate platform rules.
Sending announcements or updates to all users.
Generating activity logs and user engagement reports.
Phase 5: Upcoming Enhancements
Ratings & Feedback System: Allow users to rate their experience and leave feedback after a skill swap.
Improved Notifications: Email or in-app alerts for request updates or new messages.
Enhanced Mobile UX: Complete mobile-first design for easier skill swapping on the go.
AI-Powered Skill Matching (Optional Future Phase): Recommending potential matches based on skill compatibility and user history.
Full-stack: FastAPI (Python backend), React (JavaScript frontend). Database: MongoDB (NoSQL). Authentication: JWT, bcrypt for password hashing. Frontend Styling: Tailwind CSS. Frontend Routing: React Router. API Communication: RESTful APIs with /api prefix. Environment: Kubernetes, supervisor, .env for environment variables (REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL, MONGO_URL). Tools: bulk_file_writer, testing_agent, vision_expert_agent, yarn (frontend package management).
